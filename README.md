# Ancient Shipwrecks

The [Summary Geodatabase of Shipwrecks 1500BCE-1500CE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11fk5YeQ4eFOnYSBNpUdHp4TP42gJ7wY5/edit?gid=970169931#gid=970169931) merges two catalogs of ancient wrecks: one from the Oxford Roman Economy Project and one from Harvardâ€™s Mapping Past Societies project.

Building on scholarly research by Toby Parker, Julia Strauss, and others, the combined effort includes 1,900+ known wrecks, listing (where known) their coordinates, depth, estimated time period when wrecked, year discovered, cargo, and more.

This Shiny webapp is an interactive visualization of this ancient shipwreck data set.
